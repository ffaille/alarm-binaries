This repository hosts package and image builds for ODROID XU3/XU4/HC1/HC2/MC1.

The goal of this project is to provide ready-to-use binaries for those who do not want to go through the compilation steps.

These packages were built on an ODROID-XU4 with the official image and the packages strictly necessary for their manufacture, all provided by the archlinux ARM project and following the guides and best practices described in the official documentation.

Tested with XU4 only (don't have XU3/HC1/HC2/MC1). Seems to work fine. Feedback is welcome.

## Usage
* with [pacman](https://man.archlinux.org/man/pacman.8) and my packages on existing installation
* following [this guide](https://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv7/samsung/odroid-xu3) and my image for a new installation
